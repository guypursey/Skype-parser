###*change log*###

**Release 0.0.5** brought in a very rough-and-ready save button for one of the Rickshaw experiments to see if the chart could be saved as a png file. It could, albeit without the axes.

**Release 0.0.4** introduced JavaScript abstraction for what was previously HTML in an effort to bring in modularity and the beginnings of extensibility. Also containing purpose-built data visualisations based on [Chart](http://www.chartjs.org/), [D3](http://d3js.org/), and [Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) libraries.

**Release 0.0.3** has tabs for different (limited) views of data.
